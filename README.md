# sql_adoptable_dogs
Welcome to Laura Ebel's SQL project on adoptable dogs!

For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle.com called "Adoptable Dogs in the US" from the user "The Devastator"

My goal in this project was to analyze data about homeless dogs to try to derive some conclusions about what types of dogs or personality traits were less likely to be adopted. Using these findings, a rescue could work on making some dogs more marketable as adoptable to the right homes.
