# sql_adoptable_dogs
Welcome to Laura Ebel's SQL project on adoptable dogs!

For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle.com called "Adoptable Dogs in the US" from the user "The Devastator"

My goal in this project was to analyze data about homeless dogs to try to derive some conclusions about what types of dogs or personality traits were less likely to be adopted. Using these findings, a rescue could work on making some dogs more marketable as adoptable to the right homes. I am a huge animal lover and advocate for adopting. I also have volunteered ad rescue centers and have an adopted dog myself so this data and these findings are close to my heart.

1. I wanted to determine if purebred dogs get adopted more than mixed breed dogs. By finding out that in this data there are only 438 available purebred dogs vs 1,159 available mixed breed dogs, I can conclude that mixed breed dogs are less likely to be adopted.

2. I wanted to see how many dogs of each breed are available to determine if certain breeds get overlooked more than others when people are adopting. My hypothesis was that pitbulls would be the most available and least likely to find homes. I found that this is overwhelmingly the case; Pit Bull Terriers are the least likely to be adopted followed (not very closely) by Chihuhuas.

3. I had a hypothesis that female dogs were more popular and got adopted easier than male dogs. Therefore, I did a count of each but my hypothesis was not really correct. While there were less females available (722) than males (875), it is not by a large margin which leads me to believe that the sex of the dog does not really impact its adoptability.
